# Simple Storage Service (S3)
Wtich this web service you can send data cloud. For example: dropbox, google-drive similar to S3.

# S3 Bucket and Options
You must create bucket. And this bucket you are add antoher file and this file you can share public. I can write this web service options:
1. Bucket Versioning - If you are set version 'enable' this situation your files can be recovered. For ex: you are upload 'testfile.txt' and second you are edit file and again upluad it. When you are delete this file you can recovery this file though you are delete file. And 'show version' section you set enable and show this file. If you are recovery this file you must be delete again this file type 'Delete marker'. When delete this file and refresh windows you again view this 'testfile.txt' file.
2. Server access logging - this service you are save logs. For ex: i open 'testfile.txt' in web and this log save. This situation i create new bucket 'muradsamadov-bucket-it-logs' and i enter 'muradsamadov-bucket' bucket. 'muradsamadov-bucket-it-logs'- this bucket i save log files and my files save this bucket 'muradsamadov-bucket'. 'muradsamadov-bucket' bucket i go properties --> Server access logging. Then enable it and 'Target bucket' i browse logs bucket 'muradsamadov-bucket-it-logs'. For test i open some file in 'muradsamadov-bucket' bucket. Approximately after 15 minutes logs view  'muradsamadov-bucket-it-logs' bucket.
3. Static website hosting - this type maybe you need simple website. We have a index.html, error.html, someimage.jpg. This files are possible create simple webstite. This feaute we are possible create simple website. All the changed will be this path: S3 -> Buckets -> bucket-name -> Static website hosting. First enable it and select 'Host a static website'. Then add index.html and error.html file and save it. Then this feaute give url and open url and this website is ready. Another Hosting Type 'Redirect requests for an object' you are redirect current url to another url. For ex: include 'Host name' section which redirect url and choose this url protocol. When open bucket url redirect to entered 'Host name' url section.
Note: Default url dont open. Because ypu make public this files(index.html, error.html,someimage.jpg). Go to Bucket-name section, choose files -> Actions -> Make public using ACL. If this section is disable go to bucket-name -> Permissions -> Object Ownership -> ACLs enabled.
4. Object Lock - This feature only enable when create bucket. After the create bucket you dont enable this feature. We are talk about 'Bucket versioning' and this feaute similar to this. But in this feature maybe you are files and want to this files never must remove. For ex: index.html files never remove during 2 years.
5. Transfer acceleration - for ex: you are 2TB files and want to upload to bucket. This files upload about 10 days. If you want to upload fast you must use this feaute. This feature is paid.
6. Access control list (ACL) - S3 -> Buckets -> bucket-name -> Permissions -> Access control list (ACL) is here. This feature can permissions bucket.
7. Bucket policy - S3 -> Buckets -> bucket-name -> Permissions -> Bucket policy. This is ACL. For ex: you are want only '193.41.128.0/24' , "5.44.39.244/32" this subnet enter bucket and you can create bucket-policy. For ex:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "S3PolicyId1",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "IPAllow",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::muradsamadov-bucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::muradsamadov-bucket/*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "NotIpAddress": {
                    "aws:SourceIp": [
                        "193.41.128.0/24",
                        "5.44.39.244/32"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
Above only '193.41.128.0/24' , "5.44.39.244/32" subnet enter this bucket. More examples: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html 
8. Lifecycle rules - S3 -> Buckets -> bucket-name -> Management -> Lifecycle rules . Maybe you are want bucket files removes after a while and some versions after 100 day to files Glacier.
9. Replication rules - S3 -> Buckets -> bucket-name -> Management -> Replication rule. This feature you can replicate bucket files to another region bucket. Ä°n this case there will be no data loss. By default you are delete origin bucket files but replica bucket not delete this files. Thats why you are files in safe
10. Event notifications - S3 -> Buckets -> bucket-name -> Properties -> Event notifications. as a change in this file send email notification. For ex: put, post copy ..
11. Batch Operations - S3 -> Batch Operations. For ex: If you are to manage bucket file from one place you are create job.
12. Presigned URL - you are uplodu any bucket image and this image by default not open public. But with presigned url you are open this image temporary time. For ex: in 5 minutes expire share this image.

When you are delete this file you can recovery this file though you are delete file. And 'show version' section you set enable and show this file. If you are recovery this file you must be delet again this file type 'Delete marker'. When delet this file and refresh windows you again view this 'testfile.txt' file.

This situation i create new bucket 'muradsamadov-bucket-it-logs' and i enter 'muradsamadov-bucket' bucket. 'muradsamadov-bucket-it-logs'- this bucket i save log files and my files save this bucket 'muradsamadov-bucket'. 'muradsamadov-bucket' bucket i go properties --> Server access logging.
